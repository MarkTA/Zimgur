This is an Imgur browser created through Stephen Grider's ReactJS tutorial on Udemy.
https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReactStarter/releases

I've modified it so the user can customize the topics list by entering subreddits.
I've also added buttons to customize viewed content: page number, viral, top, time etc.
